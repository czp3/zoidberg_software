This directory serves as the OpenCV development section of the zoidberg_software repository. 

Currently there are a couple projects in progress, where you can find the details of each in `details.txt`, which include notes for future algorithms, ideas and tweaks. (now currently in /example_functions)

Feel free to `clone` this directory to experiment!

You can find the sources for the theory behind these projects below for those interested;
