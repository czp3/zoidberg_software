If you're having errors when running these files, check your python and opencv versions. This is what I'm using and it's working:
Python 2.7.15
OpenCV 2.4.11

To download this older opencv version, create a new anaconda environment and then install opencv using the following commands:

conda create --name new_environment

conda install opencv=2.4
